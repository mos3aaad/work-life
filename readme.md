# Work & Life - Python Game

Work & Life is a text-based life simulation game where players experience the daily routine of an office worker.

## Features

- 🎮 Three modes: Example (ITI Project), Randomized, and Custom Story
- 💰 Economic system with salary and purchases
- 🏥 Health and mood tracking
- 🚗 Vehicle system with fuel management
- 🏢 Office simulation with random events

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mos3aaad/work-life.git
   cd work-life
   
   --Running the game--
   python main.py

## Lessons Learned
Through developing this game, we gained valuable experience with:

#### Python Syntax

Proper use of control structures (if-else, loops)

Effective string formatting and manipulation

Working with dictionaries and lists for game state management

#### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Creating and using classes for game entities

Implementing inheritance for game objects

Encapsulation of game logic within classes

Using class methods and properties effectively

#### Modules and Libraries

Organizing code across multiple modules

Importing and using standard library modules (random, time, etc.)

Managing shared variables through a dedicated module

Creating a modular architecture for game systems
